# rock-paper-scissors
This beginner-friendly Python project is a console-based implementation of the classic "Rock, Paper, Scissors" game. The player chooses an option, the computer randomly selects one, and the winner is decided based on standard rules. The game uses simple control flow, user input handling, and ASCII art for a fun and interactive experience.
